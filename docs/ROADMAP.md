## Evaluation Checkpoint — End of Phase 9

*Status as of 2026-07-28. Written from a technical product lead / principal architect perspective after completing Phase 9 and running the full test suite (674 tests passing, 68 test files).*

### Goal delivery

The project’s core thesis — multi-dimensional datasets become interactive 3D memory palaces — is now **demonstrated end-to-end**. The constraint-driven Draco pipeline, artefact taxonomy, multi-modal input model, statistical aids, live connectors, and atmosphere layer all work together in a single WebXR/three.js runtime. Estimation: **~75 % of the foundational vision is shipped and tested**.

### Strengths

- **Architecture:** Clean separation between Engine, World, artifacts, UI, interactions, and data layers.
- **Test discipline:** 675+ Vitest tests make refactoring safe for a WebXR codebase.
- **Constraint-driven synthesis:** `DracoTopologyNode` + `ConstraintEngine` turn data facts into layout/interaction/geometry specs rather than hard-coding one chart per dataset.
- **Unified input:** `HandGestureRecognizer`, `InputRouter`, `HandPointer`, `ControllerPointer`, `DesktopControls` share one model across VR and desktop.
- **Atmosphere as signal:** Theme presets tied to dataset mood make the environment itself convey information.
- **Diegetic UI:** Panels, wheel menus, and inspector live in world space, respecting immersion.

### Critical gaps and missing capabilities

1. **Hardware/runtime validation.** Frame time and draw-call budgets are now enforced in-engine with a live Performance panel; Quest Browser GPU memory and hand-tracking latency still need device-specific measurement.
2. **Broad data ingestion.** No CSV/Excel/Parquet import, SQL/warehouse connectors, schema-mapping UI, or API authentication.
3. **Output, provenance, and sharing.** Screenshot export, JSON analysis-story export, operation-log panel, and opt-in telemetry are implemented; annotations, bookmarks, shared links, and persistent revision history are still missing.
4. **Collaboration.** Single-user only; no voice, avatars, synchronized cursors, or shared state.
5. **Accessibility.** Colorblind palette remapping, text scaling, high-contrast UI mode, and dwell-selection motor alternative are implemented. Audio descriptions and full WCAG-equivalent coverage are still missing.
6. **Graceful degradation.** GPU context loss, tracking loss mid-gesture, malformed CSVs, and network stalls need explicit recovery paths.
7. **Evidence of value.** No user studies, task benchmarks, or telemetry to prove spatial analysis improves insight speed/accuracy over 2D tools.

### Comparison with similar efforts

| Comparable | Nemosyne advantage | Nemosyne gap |
|---|---|---|
| Virtualitics | Open architecture; stronger game/diegetic UX; artefact taxonomy | Enterprise polish, validated studies, connector library, SSO |
| Tableau/Power BI | Embodied interaction and spatial memory-palace metaphor | Chart grammar, broad sharing/export, ecosystem |
| A-Frame/three.js viz demos | Real analysis operations, undo/redo, live data, tests | Usually one-off scenes without an operation model |
| Observable / D3 / Plotly | Immersion and embodied gestures | Statistical modeling breadth, notebook provenance, shareability |

Positioning: Nemosyne is best understood as an **open, web-native, metaphor-first augmentation layer** for analysts who already use notebooks or BI tools, not as a direct replacement for them today.

### Recommended decision gate before Phase 10

Do **not** jump straight into multi-user collaboration. First satisfy these four prerequisites:

1. **Quest Browser validation pass** — capture frame-time, GPU memory, and hand-tracking latency baselines.
2. **Canonical file-import flow** — CSV → `Dataset` with encoding inference, so non-developers can use the tool.
3. **First usability benchmark** — define a repeatable task (e.g., “find the top outlier”) and compare Nemosyne against a 2D dashboard.
4. **Non-functional requirements baseline** — performance budget, error boundaries, accessibility targets, telemetry, and state persistence.

Only after those four are met should the roadmap choose between **Phase 10A: Validate & Harden** or **Phase 10B: Scale & Collaborate**.

## Phase 10 — Decision Gate: Validate & Harden OR Scale & Collaborate ⏳

*Phase 10 is intentionally a fork. The prerequisites above determine which track is selected.*

### Track A — Validate & Harden (recommended if hardware/provenance gaps are not closed)

- [x] **Sprint 10A.1** — Quest Browser performance profiling and performance budget enforcement.
- [x] **Sprint 10A.2** — CSV file import with robust parsing, automatic topology/schema inference, and error boundaries (Excel/Parquet deferred to future plugin importers).
- [x] **Sprint 10A.3** — Session persistence (`IndexedDB`): dataset, camera pose, operation history, settings, tour progress, with auto-save and wheel-menu actions.
- [x] **Sprint 10A.4** — Export and provenance: PNG/WebP capture of renderer output, downloadable JSON analysis story, in-VR operation log panel.
- [x] **Sprint 10A.5** — Accessibility pass: colorblind-safe palettes, text scaling, high-contrast, motor-accessible input alternatives.
- [x] **Sprint 10A.6** — Telemetry and observability: session metrics, gesture counts, frame drops, error rates; opt-in only.
- [x] **Sprint 10A.7** — Gesture coaching and controller equivalence: running interaction commentary panel, hand-gesture to Meta Quest controller mapping, controller gesture mapper.

### Track B — Scale & Collaborate (recommended only after Track A prerequisites are satisfied)

- [x] **Sprint 10B.1** — Networking foundation (WebRTC data channels, signalling server, room model, wheel-menu join/leave, in-VR network status panel).
- [x] **Sprint 10B.2** — Free-floating, persisted HUD panels: panels no longer forced into the analyst-anchor arc, drag in cameraGroup local space, positions/visibility saved with the session.
- [x] **Sprint 10B.3** — Shared state synchronisation (dataset, operations, camera pose, selections).
- [x] **Sprint 10B.4** — Presence & avatars (voice-less or voice-optional, hand/controller avatar, name tags).
- [x] **Sprint 10B.5** — Shared annotations, bookmarks, and tours.
- [x] **Sprint 10B.6** — Asymmetric desktop companion (2D view of the same session for non-VR stakeholders).

### Deferred longer-term work

- [x] Neural predictive layer for soft-constraint weight recommendation (`NeuralConstraintPredictor.ts`).
- [ ] Convergence with upstream A-Frame component framework where feasible.
- [ ] Direct SQL / data-warehouse connectors.
- [ ] Scientific user studies comparing spatial vs. 2D analysis workflows.

## Phase 11 — On-Device AI Intelligence, Low-Token Observability & WebXR Ergonomics ✅

- [x] **Sprint 11.1 — Analyst Torso Anchor & Ergonomics**: Reparented scene anchor to analyst torso (`analystAnchor`) at `~1.35m` chest height, continuously tracking headset position and yaw orientation.
- [x] **Sprint 11.2 — Dual Vertical Multicoloured Wheel Menus**: Redesigned `HandWheelMenu.ts` into twin vertical arcs on left (`-0.36m`) and right (`+0.36m`) side of torso with wide rectangular pill geometry (`0.24m x 0.075m`), 30px+ fonts, and horizontal action fan-outs.
- [x] **Sprint 11.3 — Guided Tour Onboarding & Sequential Progression**: Fixed single-step auto-advance guards so tour counts sequentially `1/9` through `9/9`. Added Data Loading, Saving/Exporting, Collaboration, and Data Characteristics demonstration steps.
- [x] **Sprint 11.4 — On-Device UX Frustration Engine & Low-Token Observability**: Implemented `UXFrustrationAnalyzer.ts` to detect rapid repeated clicking, window thrashing, air-click misses, WASM errors, gesture misfires, and gaze/laser dwell hesitations locally. Generates 8-line token-compressed UX digests.
- [x] **Sprint 11.5 — Gaze/Laser Dwell & Gesture Confidence Telemetry**: Integrated `recordDwell()` in `SelectionDispatcher.ts` and `recordGestureConfidence()` in `WorldInputCoordinator.ts`.
- [x] **Sprint 11.6 — Geometry & Material Object Pooling**: Built `MeshPool` in `src/vr/scalability/ObjectPool.ts` and `executeInTimeSlices()` async batch execution to eliminate >200ms dataset load spikes.
- [x] **Sprint 11.7 — Customization Architecture & AI Developer Team**: Defined 4-agent team in `.agents/team.json` (`technical-architect`, `coder`, `qa-engineer`, `reviewer`) and custom Workspace Skill `.agents/skills/vr-accessibility/SKILL.md`.

## Phase 12 — AI Tuning, Gesture Validation & UX Feedback Loop Closure ✅

> **Focus:** Close the loop between the intelligence already built (Draco GA, gesture AI, frustration engine) and measurable, user-visible quality. No new major features — deepen, validate, and surface what's already there.

### Sprint 12.1 — Gesture Recognition Validation Harness

Existing coverage in `tests/hand-gesture-recognizer.test.js` tests the recognizer at unit level with synthetic `makePose` stubs, but lacks recorded trajectory fixtures, accuracy assertions, and edge-case coverage.

- [x] `tests/fixtures/gesture-sequences/` — JSON multi-frame trajectory recordings for 6 core gestures: `pinchTogether`, `pinchApart`, `swipeLeft`, `swipeRight`, `scoopUp`, `pushForward`
- [x] `tests/gesture-recognizer-accuracy.test.ts` — TP rate ≥ 90 %, FP rate ≤ 5 % per gesture, asserted from fixtures
- [x] `tests/gesture-edge-cases.test.ts` — cooldown boundary, rapid alternation, dual-hand conflict, controller-equivalent parity
- [x] `GestureConfidenceThresholds` config object in `HandGestureRecognizer` — per-gesture tunable `floor` / `ceiling` replacing magic numbers
- [x] Update `docs/INTERACTIONS.md` with a gesture confidence spec table

### Sprint 12.2 — Draco Recommender Evaluation Suite

The GA solver runs but its recommendation quality is untested against known-good outputs. `DracoDiagnosticHUD` shows weights live but gives no quality signal back to the analyst.

- [x] `tests/fixtures/draco-golden/` — golden pairs covering all primary topology types (`TABULAR`, `GRAPH`, `HIERARCHY`, `VECTOR_FIELD`, `TIME_SERIES`, `GEO`)
- [x] `tests/draco-recommender-quality.test.ts` — topology match precision ≥ 80 %, soft-constraint score evaluation on golden set
- [x] `ConstraintEngine.evaluateCandidate(spec, facts)` public method — exposed for external testability
- [x] `DracoDiagnosticHUD` improvements: live per-constraint contribution bars, last 5 candidate history, colour-coded score delta (green = improved, red = regressed)

### Sprint 12.3 — AI Module Integration & Fine-Tuning

- [x] **`NeuralConstraintPredictor`** — weight normalization & prediction evaluation
- [x] **`GestureClassifierModel`** — ONNX bridge & heuristic classification
- [x] **`UXFrustrationAnalyzer`** threshold calibration: `RAPID_ABANDONMENT` window, `REPEATED_ACTION` floor, `AIR_CLICK_MISS` rate

### Sprint 12.4 — Usability Feedback Loop Closure

- [x] **`FrustrationResponseManager`** (`src/vr/ui/FrustrationResponseManager.ts`) — when `dissatisfactionScore > threshold`, surfaces a contextual diegetic hint card near the user's gaze target
- [x] **`GestureConfidenceHUD`** panel (`src/vr/ui/GestureConfidenceHUD.ts`) — per-gesture real-time confidence bar visualization
- [x] `tests/frustration-response.test.ts` — assert hint cards appear within 2 operations of threshold breach; assert threshold adapts to expert mode

### Sprint 12.5 — UI/UX Polish & Data Transition Animations

- [x] **Artefact transition animation** — smooth lerp via `executeInTimeSlices`
- [x] **Panel visual hierarchy pass** — category-coloured left border strip (analytics `#00ffcc`, settings `#ffaa00`, collaboration `#aa44ff`)
- [x] **Empty state designs** for `DataCard`, `OperationLog`, `ChartPlane`

### Sprint 12.6 — Analyst Benchmark Suite (Evidence of Value)

*First structured evidence that spatial analysis delivers real analyst benefit.*

| # | Task | Dataset | Success criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *Find the top outlier* | Financial scatter | Correct node selected via inspector |
| 2 | *Identify the dominant cluster* | Geospatial | Correct cluster label confirmed |
| 3 | *Trace a causal path* | Process-flow hierarchy | Correct leaf-to-root path activated |
| 4 | *Spot a temporal anomaly* | Time-series | Anomaly node inspected within time budget |
| 5 | *Compare two encodings* | Any | Both carousel candidates evaluated, one confirmed |

- [x] **`BenchmarkSession`** (`src/utils/BenchmarkSession.ts`) — instruments each task with `timeToFirstCorrectSelection`, `gestureCount`, `operationCount`, `frustrationScoreAtCompletion`
- [x] Benchmark results exported as JSON alongside the existing analysis story export
- [x] `tests/benchmark-session.test.ts` — all 5 tasks pass under deterministic simulated input

### Sequencing

```
12.1 → 12.3  (gesture fixtures feed AI accuracy tests)
12.2 → 12.3  (golden Draco set feeds predictor eval)
12.1 + 12.2 → 12.6  (benchmark tasks use both)
12.4 → 12.5  (feedback polish builds on closed loop)
```

## Phase 13 — Real-World Data Ingestion & Provenance Export Infrastructure ✅

> **Focus:** Make Nemosyne production-ready for arbitrary analyst datasets. Enable non-developers to load CSV files with automatic schema inference, support binary Arrow IPC streams, export interactive 3D analysis storybooks, and handle WebGL context loss gracefully.

### Sprint 13.1 — CSV/TSV Auto-Inference & Field Mapping UI

- [x] `CSVDataParser.ts` — robust client-side CSV/TSV parser handling quoted fields, escaped delimiters, missing values, and automatic type inference (`NUMERIC`, `CATEGORICAL`, `TEMPORAL`)
- [x] `SchemaMappingPanel.ts` — in-VR panel letting analysts confirm column type assignments, cycle types, and apply updated field mappings
- [x] `tests/csv-parser.test.ts` — test suite verifying quoted field parsing, numeric casting, date detection, and type cycling

### Sprint 13.2 — Apache Arrow IPC & FlatBuffers Binary Parsers

- [x] `ArrowBinaryParser.ts` — zero-copy Apache Arrow IPC stream reader extracting Float32 position buffers directly targeting `InstancedPointCloud` attributes
- [x] `tests/arrow-ipc.test.ts` — test suite asserting zero-copy memory parsing accuracy

### Sprint 13.3 — Spatial Analysis Storybook & Provenance Export

- [x] Client-side browser download trigger helper
- [x] `tests/storybook-context-recovery.test.ts` — test suite verifying storybook bundle serialization

### Sprint 13.4 — Session Recovery & WebGL Context Loss Safety

- [x] `ContextRecoveryManager.ts` — detects WebGL context loss (`webglcontextlost`), preserves state, and restores GPU buffers on `webglcontextrestored`
- [x] `tests/storybook-context-recovery.test.ts` — test suite simulating WebGL context loss and verifying recovery dispatch

---

## Phase 14 — WebXR Performance, GPU Caching & Memory Optimization ⏳

> **Focus:** Eliminate frame-time spikes and memory allocation garbage collection during WebXR analytics sessions on Meta Quest standalone hardware. Implement dynamic canvas texture diff caching, sub-range GPU buffer updates, and an adaptive 90 FPS frame governor.

### Sprint 14.1 — Canvas Texture GPU Re-Upload Caching

- [ ] `CanvasTextureCacheManager.ts` — dirty-rect and content hashing manager for `MovablePanel` and `HandWheelMenu` preventing unnecessary dynamic canvas texture GPU re-uploads during user interaction
- [ ] `tests/canvas-texture-cache.test.ts` — test suite asserting canvas texture upload skip rate > 80% on unchanged UI frames

### Sprint 14.2 — Sub-Range GPU Buffer Updates for InstancedPointCloud

- [ ] `InstancedPointCloud` partial buffer update methods (`updateSubRange(offset, count)`) allowing filtered and clustered point subsets to update GPU attribute sub-ranges without full geometry buffer rebuilds
- [ ] `tests/subrange-buffer.test.ts` — test suite verifying partial GPU attribute buffer updates

### Sprint 14.3 — Adaptive WebXR Frame & Thermal Governor

- [ ] `AdaptiveFrameGovernor.ts` — continuously monitors WebXR frame render time; dynamically scales particle counts, LOD culling distances, and shadow resolution when frame time breaches 11.1ms (90 FPS target on Quest 3S)
- [ ] `tests/adaptive-governor.test.ts` — test suite simulating frame time spikes and verifying governor LOD scaling response
